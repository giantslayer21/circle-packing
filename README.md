# circle-packing
Code related to a circle packing project at my personal website. See [http://jdobr.es/blog/algorithmic-art-circle-pack/][2]

## circle_packing_demo.html

Demonstrates a quadtree-based circle packing algorithm identical to the one currently used on my [personal website][1].

## circle_packing_race.html

Compares the quadtree solution to a more naive "linear search" method, side by side. Maximum size of the circles can be adjusted to explore how this impacts relative search times.
